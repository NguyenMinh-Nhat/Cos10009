[0:00] Tumblr Girls – G-Eazy

[00:31] 'Cause I'm in love with these Tumblr girls  
[00:34] With skinny waists and habits  
[00:36] Pretty faces, love status  
[00:38] She acts as if she's the baddest  
[00:40] Man, I swear she's just like tons of girls  
[00:43] She expects the free drinks  
[00:45] And I'm successful, she thinks  
[00:47] Always comes around  

[00:49] We off and on, off and on  
[00:51] Only ever really off and on  
[00:53] Never see her these days 'cause I'm off and gone  
[00:56] When I'm home, off tour, never stop for long  
[00:59] Back this week from across the pond  
[01:01] Notice I was close to the block she's on  
[01:04] Elevator to the floor her loft is on  
[01:06] Drinking whiskey, she likes vodka strong  

[01:09] But after we, it's over  
[01:11] Walk out the door, that's closure  
[01:13] No, I can't stay here and hold her  
[01:15] Tomorrow act like I don't know her  
[01:18] Wouldn't ever be here sober  
[01:20] Can't tell which one is colder  
[01:22] My clothing's on, we both did wrong  
[01:25] I gotta go, that's what I told her, yeah  

[01:27] Uh, she says she can't feel her face  
[01:30] Yeah, right now I can't feel my heart  
[01:32] Uh, for your feelings there's no place  
[01:35] Yeah, but you knew that from the start  

[01:38] You and I, we're made of glass, we'd never last  
[01:41] You and I, we're made of glass, we'd never last  
[01:44] Quick to die, we moved fast and then we crashed  
[01:47] You and I, we're made of glass, we'd never last  

[01:50] She's fine as f*** and she knows it  
[01:52] Sexy body, she shows it  
[01:54] Loves the drama, she chose it  
[01:56] She draws the line and she blows it  
[01:59] The most fun, I suppose it  
[02:01] Pops a bottle, won't close it  
[02:03] Fills a fifth, then she throws it  
[02:05] She pops a bar, now she's dozing  

[02:08] She's hot and cold, hot and cold  
[02:10] Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold  
[02:12] Truly the bullshit has gotten old  
[02:14] Superficial with a rotten soul  
[02:17] Off and on, now I stop and go  
[02:19] Probably got someone, choose not to know  
[02:21] Head to her place then we lock the door  
[02:24] Making bad calls when I'm off the blow  

[02:26] 'Cause she's a bitch, I'm selfish  
[02:28] Want every girl, can't help it  
[02:30] And it's tough for me to shelf it  
[02:33] It's you I see myself with  
[02:35] Right now I know you felt it  
[02:37] I touched her, then she melted  
[02:39] We shouldn't chill, but we do it still  
[02:41] Got to play the hand if you dealt it, yeah  

[02:44] Uh, she says she can't feel her face  
[02:46] Yeah, right now I can't feel my heart  
[02:49] Uh, before you feel this, there's no place  
[02:52] Yeah, but you knew that from the start  

[02:55] You and I, we're made of glass, we'd never last  
[02:58] You and I, we're made of glass, we'd never last  
[03:01] Quick to die, we moved fast and then we crashed  
[03:04] You and I, we're made of glass  

[03:07] Missing everything you say  
[03:09] It's not important what you stand for  
[03:12] You're asking, "Will he be the one?"  
[03:14] I'll be gone before you're done tonight  

[03:17] Waiting for another day  
[03:19] You're not getting what you paid for  
[03:21] Trying to salvage what's undone  
[03:24] And deny you got outrun tonight  

[03:27] Never knew her name  
[03:29] They're looking all the same to me  
[03:31] They only chase the fame  
[03:33] There's no one left to blame but me  

[03:37] (Instrumental outro…)
